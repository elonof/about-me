# Hi there! I'm Elono ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 13-year-old reverse-engineering developer with a focus on the Roblox platform. I'm passionate about understanding how the Roblox engine works and using that knowledge to create exciting new experiences for players.

I started tinkering with games at a young age, and my love for reverse-engineering began when I discovered the Roblox platform. Since then, I've been exploring the depths of the Roblox engine, creating new tools and experiences for players.

## What I'm Working On
Right now, I'm working on nothing due to school reasons, but in my freetime I am working on "YourPlayground" which aims to give users advantage in the game "Marvellous Playground" in Roblox.

## How to Get in Touch
If you're a fellow developer looking to collaborate on a new project, or just someone interested in learning more about reverse-engineering on Roblox, feel free to reach out! You can contact me through the online chatting platform 'discord', **elonof#4867**.
